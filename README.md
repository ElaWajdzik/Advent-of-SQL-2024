# <p align="center"> Advent of SQL 2024 üéÑ

A new advent calendar for all enthusiasts of SQL: https://adventofsql.com/.

I know SQL pretty well, but this kind of challenge is a good opportunity to learn something new or refresh my knowledge. I use a PostgreSQL database, version 17.2.

## Bonus question

Because the main question for Day 17 doesn't have an answer, I changed it a little bit and added the results.

**Day 17 Main Question**: Find all possible 60-minute meeting windows where all participating workshops are within their business hours.

**Bonus Question**: Find the 60-minute time windows during which the maximum number of workshops can participate within their business hours. How many workshops need to change their business hours to create a meeting that includes all workshops?

```sql
WITH working_hours_in_utc AS (
	SELECT 
	    workshop_id,
		--convert business start and end times to UTC time zone
	    (TIMESTAMP '2024-12-19 ' + business_start_time) AT TIME ZONE timezone AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AS business_start_utc,
	    (TIMESTAMP '2024-12-19 ' + business_end_time) AT TIME ZONE timezone AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AS business_end_utc
	FROM Workshops
	),

workshop_hours AS (
	SELECT 
        workshop_id,
		--generate time slots (every 30 minutes) between business start and end times
		TO_CHAR(generate_series(
            business_start_utc, 
            business_end_utc - INTERVAL '1 second', 
            INTERVAL '30 minutes'), 'HH24:MI') AS hour
    FROM working_hours_in_utc
	)

SELECT 
--select time slots and count the number of workshops that can participate in each slot
	hour,
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_workshops
FROM workshop_hours
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY number_of_workshops DESC, hour ASC;
```

The table `Workshops` contains information about the working hours of 67 workshops across the world. As a result of the query, between 9:00 UTC and 12:30 UTC, almost all (66 out of 67) workshops are available during their working hours. The time window between 9:00 and 12:30 UTC will be the best time to schedule the meetings.

The one workshop that doesn't operate within this time frame is Workshop 4, which is located in New York and operates between 14:30 and 22:30 UTC.

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/AC_d17_2.png" >

The best option to schedule the meeting for all workshops is to choose the time between 11:30 and 12:30. For 66 out of 67 workshops, they will be able to participate in that meeting during their business hours. The workshop in New York, however, should exceptionally start working 3 hours earlier than usual on that day. This means that on that day, the workshop in New York should start working at 6:30 AM local time.
